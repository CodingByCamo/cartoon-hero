        <h2>About Sonic</h2>
        <p>Sonic is the greatest character to ever grace our screens. In fact, the only character that even comes close would be Bunnie Rabbot, who is a part of the Sonic franchise anyway.</p>
        <img src="image/confusedrabbot.jpg">
        <p>Bunnie Rabbot, the character who is just as badass as Sonic</p>
        <h2>Sonic and Bunnie's attributes</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sonic is super fast</li>
            <li>Bunnie is part robot and has super strength</li>
            <li>Sonic and Bunnie are badass for completely different reasons</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Sonic's friends</h2>
        <p>Sonic has many different friends. I think some of his friends are also badass. 
        his best friends are from the cartoon series. Click the links below to see more about them:</p>
